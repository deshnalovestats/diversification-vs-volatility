# 📈 Portfolio Diversification and Risk Reduction

This project analyzes daily stock price data of NIFTY 50 companies to understand the impact of diversification on investment risk and return. It was developed as part of the *Introduction to Data Science* course at IIITDM Kancheepuram.

## 📊 Overview

The notebook explores how different portfolio compositions affect overall volatility and performance. The study involves constructing multiple portfolios with varying levels of diversification and evaluating their performance using financial metrics.

### 🔍 Key Features

- Constructed and compared multiple portfolios: single-stock, moderately diversified, and fully diversified.
- Measured portfolio performance using:
  - 📉 **Volatility**
  - 📈 **Return**
  - 🧠 **Sharpe Ratio**
- Demonstrated that diversified portfolios offer better risk-adjusted returns than concentrated ones.
